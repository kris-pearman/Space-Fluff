# Space Fluff

Space Fluff is a single level space shooter written in Pico-8. Over the course of about 3 months of lunch breaks. My first final "finished" game attempt.

# Controls

Default pico-8 controls, arrow keys to move, z and x are the default buttons, z shoots, x starts the game. Enter should allow you to pause.
